		<p>The Tata Memorial Centre is the national comprehensive cancer centre for the prevention, treatment, education and research in Cancer and is recognized as one of the leading cancer centres in this part of the world. This achievement has been possible due to the far-sighted and total support of the Department of Atomic Energy, under Dr. Homi N Sethna responsible for managing this Institution since 1962.</p>
